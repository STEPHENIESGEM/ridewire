# RideWire Project Scope

## Purpose

RideWire is a **business intelligence and automation platform** designed to help entrepreneurs, small business owners, and commercial teams make data-driven decisions and scale their operations effectively.

## In Scope ✅

RideWire accepts and supports features related to:

- **Business Analytics & Dashboards**: KPIs, metrics, visualization, reporting
- **Strategic Planning**: Business strategy, execution frameworks, roadmaps
- **Market Intelligence**: Competitive analysis, industry research, market trends
- **Funding & Revenue**: Financial modeling, funding strategies, revenue optimization
- **Team Collaboration**: Workflow automation, communication frameworks, project management
- **AI-Powered Business Tools**: Machine learning for business insights, prediction, optimization
- **Templates & Resources**: Business templates, frameworks, best practices

## Out of Scope ❌

RideWire **does not support and will not accept** contributions related to:

- Military, defense, or warfare systems
- Conflict management or de-escalation frameworks
- War preparedness or crisis response tools
- Geopolitical surveys or conflict intelligence
- Emergency response or disaster management (unless business continuity focused)
- Any content unrelated to commercial business operations

## Why This Matters

Clear project scope ensures:
1. **Focus**: Resources go toward business intelligence excellence
2. **Community Alignment**: Contributors work toward shared business goals
3. **Legal Clarity**: Avoids potential issues with defense/military regulations
4. **Brand Identity**: RideWire is known for business solutions, not crisis management

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether a feature fits RideWire's scope, ask yourself:
- "Does this help a business make better decisions?"
- "Would a small business owner or entrepreneur use this for their company?"
- "Is this about commercial operations and growth?"

If yes to all three, it's likely in scope. If not, it may be better suited for a different project.

## Enforcement

Issues, pull requests, or contributions that fall outside this scope will be:
1. Politely declined with reference to this document
2. Closed without implementation
3. Redirected to more appropriate projects if possible
